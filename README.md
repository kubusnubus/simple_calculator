# simple_calculator

A clumsily coded simple "smart" calculator, my first "real" coding project.

## SUPPORTED FEATURES:
* functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial, sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan, exp, ln, log, productlog, sqrt, floor, ceil, mod, sum (capital sigma), product (capital pi), definite integral
* parentheses
* constants: pi, e

## USAGE:
* Write your expression, press ENTER and the result will be written out.
* At this point, the only allowed variables is 'k' for summation (this way, the result will also be a number (or an error)).

## OTHER ERRORS:
* A inequality between opening and closing parentheses will result in an error.
* Unsupported functions/constants will cause an error.
